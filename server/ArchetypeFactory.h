/// \brief Concrete factory template for creating in-game entity objects through archetypes.
///
/// An archetype contains one or many entities along with optional thoughts (for NPCs etc).
/// Attributes can refer to other entities by using the entity reference format, whereby a map
/// with a string entry with the key "$eid" is used.
/// If no "objtype" is specified in the entity sent to newEntity the data therein is handled
/// as entity initialization data. The properties specified (except "parents") will all be
/// applied to the first entity created.
/// This behaviour is default in order to make sure archetypes and entities can be created
/// interchangeably.
///
/// If however the "objtype" is set to "archetype" the attributes are expected to follow the
/// format of an archetype, and will be merged into the parent archetype. This mainly means
/// that the code will look for entity definitions in the "entities" attribute, and thought
/// definitions in the "thoughts" attribute.
